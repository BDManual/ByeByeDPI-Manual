> [!IMPORTANT]
> DPI bypass is a hacking technique. It refers to a technique that is resisted by the environment, is not automatically guaranteed to work in all conditions and on all resources, and requires customisation for specific conditions at your ISP. Conditions may change over time and the technique may start or stop working, and may need to be re-analysed. You may discover individual resources that are blocked differently that are not working or have stopped working. Individual unblocked resources may also break. It is therefore highly desirable to have knowledge of networks to be able to analyse the technical situation. It is not unreasonable to have bypass proxy channels in case bypassing DPI does not work.
